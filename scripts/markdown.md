- Tournament structure (Qualifiers, rounds and a final, or a single round)
- Winner criteria (How is the winner chosen?)
- Expected duration (4 hours for the entire tournament, or does it span multiple days?)
- Required resources (Do you need our server, or host your own?)
- Contact information

[Send us an email](/contact) with all these details and we will get back to you!

Official tournaments have priority, which means your tournament should be flexible enough be held at any
point during the weekend. We prefer short compact tournaments, but don't let that stop you from proposing an 
amazing multi-day event. There is no limit to the duration of the tournament, but the format should be taken into
account. A truly competitive tournament should not take more than a morning or afternoon, while a casual
long term tournaments can span multiple days.

We will review your proposal, and when accepted, weâ€™ll appoint you as responsible person to run this
tournament. This means the entire organisation of the tournament will be up to you. Your tournament will be
placed on the website. but we can not offer any extra support for your tournament during the event.
