        This document contains the general terms and conditions for “Area5LAN”, taking place from the 3rd of June until the 5th of June 2016, from now on referenced to as “the event”. The event is established by “Student Association for Mathematics and Computer Science ‘Christiaan Huygens’” through the “LanCie Committee 2015-2016”, these two parties are from now on referenced to as “the organization”. Any other individual that is legally present at, or has the authority to be present at the event while not being part of the organization is considered to be a participant, if not stated otherwise. Every individual at the event must follow these terms and conditions.    
        <h3>1 Validity</h3>
        The organization reserves the right to modify these general terms and conditions until the start date of the event without any form of report of reason. The Dutch legislation is in effect at all times. Any violation of the terms and conditions will be punished by a fee of an appropriate amount, determined by the organization unless specified otherwise.
        <h3>2 Tickets</h3>
        <h4>2.1 Purchasing tickets</h4>
        Official tickets can only be purchased through the official website: https//areafiftylan.nl. Tickets retrieved through any other source will not be accepted. Purchasing a ticket automatically means the buyer accepts these terms and conditions. Any data given will not be shared with third parties. The tickets will be on sale until at the latest 1 (one) week before the actual event. After this, the ticket sale will be closed.
        <h4>2.2 Members of W.I.S.V. Christiaan Huygens</h4>
        The event is, among others, hosted by the “Student Association for Mathematics and Computer Science Christiaan Huygens”. All members of this study association who wish to attend the event, can purchase a ticket for a lower price. Please note that your membership will be verified upon entering the event. If it appears you are not a member, but you still purchased a members-ticket, you will be asked to still pay the remaining costs of the ticket for a non-CH member. If you do not agree, you will be asked to leave the event.
        <h4>2.3 Tickets are sold out</h4>
        If tickets appear to be sold out, one can be put on a waiting list. There will be no second round of the ticket sale, meaning the waiting list is the only way of getting a ticket. Once a ticket is available, you will be noted of the person trying to sell the ticket. The ticket resale will only take place between the buyer and the seller. The organization will do nothing more than providing the buyers contact info.
        <h4>2.2 Resale of tickets</h4>
        The reseller may charge the new buyer at maximum the original price; no profits must be made. The reseller is responsible for this exchange, including providing the organization with the right data.
