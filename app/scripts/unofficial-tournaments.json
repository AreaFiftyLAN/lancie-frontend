    "description": "Minecraft is a sandbox video game created by Swedish programmer Markus 'Notch' Persson and later developed and published by Mojang. The creative and building aspects of Minecraft enable players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world. Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat. Multiple gameplay modes are available, including survival mode where the player must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, a creative mode where players have unlimited resources to build with and the ability to fly, an adventure mode where players can play custom maps created by other players, and a spectator mode where players can fly around and clip through blocks, but cannot place or destroy any.",

The game is similar to the game Tron, where players leave a trail and try to make the opponent hit a wall or a trail first. The game is controlled by only two buttons, to turn left or right. A key difference is that in Achtung, die Kurve!, players can turn and travel in any direction, not limited to the 4 cardinal directions.\n\n#### Start time\nSaturday 23:30\n\n#### Game format\nFree-for-all, 4 players per game, knockout\n\n#### Tournament structure\nDepends on number of participants\n\n#### Winner criteria\nBeat everyone, shout Achtung! the loudest of everyone everytime\n\n#### Additional info\nThe game has bugs... I mean features. Losing because of a 'feature' is just having bad luck, sorry, can't do anything about it. Hate the game, not the tournament director!
