### What does the event look like this year?

As you can probably imagine AreaFiftyLAN will be pretty different, as safety of our participants and staff will always come first.
With this in mind, we had to make the hard choice to organize the event completely online this year.
Don't worry, it will still be an continuous three day event packed with tournaments and casual games.
To tie it all together we will have a stream running for a large portion of the day.

### When will the event take place?

The event will take place from Friday the 26th of February till Sunday the 28th. Further details will be released at a later date.

### I don't have any friends who want to participate, will it still be fun?

Yes! There will be plenty of opportunity to socialize with other participants and we will try to create groups of single players.

### Are there still prizes this year?

Yes, of course. We will have comparable prizes available as last year. More details will follow later. On top of that we will have a (limited amount of) goodie bags available.

### I still have questions, where can I ask them?

You can send any questions either in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/QefnMzNGG6) server, or through the [contact](/contact) form.
