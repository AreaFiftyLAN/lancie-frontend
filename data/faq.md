### When will the event take place?

The event will take place from Friday the 27th of May till Sunday the 29th of May. Further details will be made available at a later date.

### What does the event look like this year?

As you can probably imagine AreaFiftyLAN will be pretty depended on the corona measures at the time.
We will try our utmost best to host a physical AreaFiftyLAN. However, there could be some changes if there is a maximum capacity per hall. If no physical event is allowed, we switch to an online event. We will make sure we plan ahead as far as possible and have a proper back-up plan, as well as keep you updated.

### Is there a minimum age to participate?

No, there is not. If you are younger than 18, you should be able to present any form of authorization by caretakers/parents upon entry to the event.

### Am I allowed bringing my own food to the event?

During the event, up to three meals per day will be provided by the organization (breakfast, lunch, and dinner on Saturday and breakfast and lunch on Sunday). These meals are included in the price of the ticket, so you will not be charged extra. Outside these meals, you can bring limited food and drinks of your own. If you order any food, stay alert for any delivery people to arrive! Any deliveries not claimed will be taken by us to keep the delivery people from waiting.

### Do you still have the pick up service

No, there is no pickup service this year.

### Can I bring my own chair?

Yes, you can. We will provide chairs for all participants, but you can also take your own. You do have to bring it yourself and it is your own responsibility. If it breaks during the event, it will be at your own risk.

### Can I sleep on location?

We will again try to make sure that there is a sleeping area for participants, however, we do need to comply with the corona measurements at that time. So It possibly is not allowed.

### Are there showers and toilets on location?

### Can I come to the event as a spectator?

Unfortunately, it is too hard for us to keep track of visitors. Since we want to keep your belongings secure, we do not welcome anyone without a ticket. Especially with the corona measurements that might apply during the event.

### I accidentally bought the wrong ticket. Oops! What now?

If you bought a ticket with a discount, but you are not entitled to it, you have to pay for it before the event. Upon signing in on Friday, we will check if you are a CH member, if not, you have to pay another â‚¬5,- before you can enter.

### I don't have any friends who want to participate, will it still be fun?

### I still have questions, where can I ask them?
