Overwatch is a first-person shooter that features squad-based combat with two opposing teams. Players choose one of several hero characters, each with their own unique abilities and role classes. Each hero has a primary attack or skill and at least two additional skills that can be invoked at any time, some requiring a brief cooldown period before they can be used again.\r\n# Rules\r\n## 1.
