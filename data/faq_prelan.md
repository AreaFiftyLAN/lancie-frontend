### When will the Pre-LAN take place?

The event will take place Friday the 25th of February. Further details will be made available later.

### What does the Pre-LAN look like this year?

Just like last year the Pre-LAN will be held online. So, everyone can participate from the comfort of their own home.

### Is there a minimum age to participate?

No, there is not. If you are younger than 18, you should be able to present any form of authorisation by caretakers/parents upon entry to the event.

### I don't have any friends who want to participate, will it still be fun?

Yes! There will be plenty of opportunities to socialise with other participants and we will try to create groups of single players.

### Are there still prizes this year?

Yes, of course. We will have comparable prizes available as last year. More details will follow later.

### I still have questions, where can I ask them?

You can send any questions either in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/WGrks2A8As) server or through the [contact](/contact) form.
