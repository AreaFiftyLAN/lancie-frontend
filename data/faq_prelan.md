The event will take place Friday the 25th of Februari. Further details will be made available at a later date.

### What does the Pre-LAN look like this year?

Just like last year the Pre-LAN will be held online. So everyone can participate from the comfort of their own home.

### I don't have any friends who want to participate, will it still be fun?

Yes! There will be plenty of opportunities to socialize with other participants and we will try to create groups of single players.

Yes, of course. We will have comparable prizes available as last year. More details will follow later.

### I still have questions, where can I ask them?

You can send any questions either in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/WGrks2A8As) server or through the [contact](/contact) form.
