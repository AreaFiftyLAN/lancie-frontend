    "description": "Overwatch puts players into two teams of six, with each player selecting one of several pre-defined hero characters with unique movement, attributes, and abilities; these heroes are divided into four classes: Offense, Defense, Tank and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map and\/or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Overwatch is a first-person shooter that features squad-based combat with two opposing teams. Players choose one of several hero characters, each with their own unique abilities and role classes. Each hero has a primary attack or skill and at least two additional skills that can be invoked at any time, some requiring a brief cooldown period before they can be used again.\r\n# Rules\r\n## 1.
