    "description": "Civilization 6 is a turn- based strategy game. In this game you must bring your civilization to high prosperity, however, you are not the only one. Other players will be competing with you over resources, land, great people and overall influence in the world. With a lot of variety in civilizations to choose from, and a lot of different victory conditions this game always has a different feel to it. \n\n # Rules # \n\n ## 1. Format: ##\n\n \n\n1. Players will be competing on an individual basis. \n\n2. The tournament consists of two phases. First, a group phase consisting of multiple 4-6 player games. Second, a final where the winners of each game will compete for the title. \n\n3. A copy of the DLC Gathering Storm is required to participate. \n\n4. The chosen map will be shuffled with the standard settings and map size tiny for 4 players and small for 5+. \n\n5. Starting locations will be set to balanced. \n\n6. All victory conditions will be enabled. \n\n7. The game speed will be set to online with a dynamic turn timer on. \n\n8.

If a participant behaves in any unsportsmanlike way it is possible that they receive a penalty, to the sole discretion of the administrators. \n\n3. It is a players responsibility to be on time for their matches, if they are late they will suffer a penalty. This will be losing the entire match after 30 minutes so as to not delay the entire tournament. A player is required to inform the tournament staff if they are late for a match, including a valid reason. If not they will be dropped from the tournament. \n\n5. Every hour one 5 minute break is allowed during a match. \n\n6. Coaching is not allowed during a match. \n\n7. Forms of communication with other participants outside of the game to discuss strategy or make deals to, for example, target a specific player are prohibited and may result in a penalty or disqualification. \n\n## 3. Technical Issues ##\n\n If a game is interrupted due to technical reasons and the game is heavily favoured towards a specific player, an administrator may rule the game in favour of said player. Should the game be too close to call, it will be replayed. \n\n## 4. Tournament Eligibility ##\n\n \n\n1. Participants which have a conflict of interest may be excluded from tournaments. \n\n2. The current organising committee (LANcie) have the final say in tournament eligibility. \n\n## 5. Penalties ##\n\n Depending on the situation a player could be penalised in any of the following ways: \n\n \n\n1. Score penalization \n\n2. Missing a turn \n\n3. Disqualification from the tournament entirely \n\n## 6. Drop out ##\n\n If a player decides to drop out of the tournament they are required to contact the administrators and sign a drop out sheet for confirmation.
