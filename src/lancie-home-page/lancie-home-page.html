        <p>Is your favorite game not listed as a tournament? No problem! We offer you the possibility to become a game<br>
          master! For this, we would like to receive a proposal for your tournament. Your proposal should contain the<br>
          following information.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Which game you want to host</li>
          <li>Game format (Free-for all, 5 vs 5, 1 vs 1, etc)</li>
          <li>Tournament structure (Qualifiers, rounds and a final, or a single round)</li>
          <li>Winner criteria (How is the winner chosen?)</li>
          <li>Expected duration (4 hours for the entire tournament, or does it span multiple days?)</li>
          <li>Required resources (Do you need our server, or host your own?)</li>
          <li>Contact information</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="/contact">Send us an email</a> with all these details and we will get back to you!</p>
        <p>Official tournaments have priority, which means your tournament should be flexible enough be held at any
          point during the weekend. We prefer short compact tournaments, but don’t let that stop you from proposing an
          amazing multi-day event. There is no limit to the duration of the tournament, but the format should be taken
          into account. A truly competitive tournament should not take more than a morning or afternoon, while a casual
          long term tournaments can span multiple days.</p>
        <p>We will review your proposal, and when accepted, we’ll appoint you as responsible person to run this<br>
          tournament. This means the entire organisation of the tournament will be up to you. Your tournament will be<br>
          placed on the website. but we can not offer any extra support for your tournament during the event.</p>
