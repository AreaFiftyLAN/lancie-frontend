            Area FiftyLAN is the annual gaming event held at the TU Delft. From 2 till 4 March
            more than 200 gamers will spend the weekend having a blast playing games
            together. It is organized by the study assosciation of Applied
            Mathematics and Computer Science &amp; Engineering, W.I.S.V. ‘Christiaan Huygens',

            welcome to bring their PCs to play their favourite games with their friends.
            There will be official tournaments where you can win amazing prizes. Besides the
            official tournaments, you can team up and have fun with more casual games as well
            or organize your own tournament.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are no hardcore gamer, don’t worry. There are also enough offline-games
            to play with. Think about arcade cabinets, retro consoles and board games. More
            information about the event will be published at a later date.

        <p>There are multiple official tournaments that will be organized by the committee.
          These tournaments feature large prize pools, so expect the competition to
          be fierce. If your favorite game is not listed here do not worry, you can organize
          your own! Contact us to get the ball rolling, more information on how to do that is
          found below.</p>

    <lancie-section type="primary" header="Organize your own tournament!">
      <div>
        <p>Is your favorite game not listed as an official tournament? We offer the
          possibility to host this tournament yourself. To set up your own tournament
          you need to write a proposal for your tournament. This proposal should contain the
          following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Which game you want to host</li>
          <li>Game format (Free-for all, 5 vs 5, 1 vs 1, etc)</li>
          <li>Tournament structure (Qualifiers, rounds and a final, or a single round)</li>
          <li>Winner criteria (How is the winner chosen?)</li>
          <li>Expected duration (4 hours for the entire tournament, or does it span multiple days?)</li>
          <li>Required resources (Do you need our server, or host your own?)</li>
          <li>Contact information</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="/contact">Send us an email</a> with all these details and we will get back to you!</p>
        <p>Please consider the official tournaments and their tight schedule when wanting to host
           a large tournament. We prefer short compact tournaments, but don't let that stop you
           from proposing an amazing multi-day event. There is no limit to the duration of the
           tournament, but the format should be considered. A truly competitive tournament should
           not take more than a morning or afternoon, while a casual long-term tournament can span
           multiple days.</p>
        <p>After we receive your proposal through the contact form, we will review it and hopefully accept it.
          When that happens, we appoint you as the responsible person to run the tournament. This
          means that entire organization of the tournament will be up to you. Our own support for
          the tournament will be minimal but we will help you gain other enthusiastic gamers by
          placing your tournament on our site for others to sign up. If you are interested in
          sponsoring one of the unofficial tournaments, you can find our contact information below.</p>
