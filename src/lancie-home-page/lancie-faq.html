      <h4>What is Area FiftyLAN?</h4>
        <p>Area FiftyLAN is an awesome LAN party organised by the LANcie, a committee made up out of members of the study association W.I.S.V. ‘Christaan Huygens’. It will take place from the 3rd of March until the 5th of March at the Unit of Sports and Culture of the TU Delft. LAN stands for Local Area Network, which means that all participants will be on the same network during the entire event. This way they’ll be able to play lag-free gaming sessions with other people. During the weekend there will also be other activities, like laser gaming, a poker tournament, offline boardgames and even an escaperoom.</p>

        <h4>How do I set up a tournament?</h4>
